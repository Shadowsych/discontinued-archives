# EZSploit Overview
This project is now discontinued. It was too much to program within Kali Linux, but it's still useful to 
look into for certain technologies.
EZSploit (or Easy Exploit) is a Java-based application that is used as a hacking device with an easy GUI to penetrate test your website, computer, or mobile phone. This is an open-source project worked on by Pravat Bhusal.
Proper documentation is provided below the README.

# Dependencies
EZSploit uses JavaFx GUI Components to make an easy-to-use interface for the user.

In order to use the project, you must use the Linux Distro named "Kali Linux"
Here's the download to the .iso file for Kali Linux:
 - https://www.kali.org/downloads/

In order for you to hack outside of your LAN connection, you must portforward your machine to allow metasploit to attack through WAN.
Documentation will be provided for this soon.

# Installation
- Open a Kali Linux Terminal and type "apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk" to install the Java 8 JDK and JRE
- Then in the same Terminal type "apt-get install openjfx" to install the Java FX support for Kali Linux
More instructions coming soon...
